The program was run on grad.cse.usf.edu.

I compiled the code using comspile.sh

Only a single operation can be performed at one time. 

videoprocess <operation_name> <source_file> <target file prefix> roi <optional parameter>

the encoding back to video has to be done using encodeframes_grad binary separately.

The frames are always saved in .ppm format, however the frames are converted to greay scale for performing the grey-scale operations.
